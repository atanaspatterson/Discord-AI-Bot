# Discord-AI-Bot
A cute little bot that responds to hello &amp; accepts some / commands for image generation and AMA. OpenAI &amp; Discord APIs make the magic happen under the hood. 
Did alongside USFCA ACM Club, so the rest of this description is from their repo:

A discord bot that uses the OpenAI API to answer user questions and generate image embeds!
